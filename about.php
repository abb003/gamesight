			This page will tell you a little about myself and what this site will accomplish in the future.

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
		
			My life has been full of video games from the first time I held that Nintendo controller and played Legend of Zelda to the last time I took up a game
			of Dark Souls 2 on the PS3. Games are one of my many passions and hobbies in life and without them I am not sure I would be the same person.<br />
